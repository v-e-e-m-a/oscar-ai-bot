"""npm / yarn ecosystem strategy.

Fixes a CVE in a JavaScript project by bumping the vulnerable package, routed by
where it's declared in package.json:

  - direct dependency, no resolution -> ``yarn upgrade <pkg>@<version>``
  - in ``resolutions`` (alone or also a direct dep) -> edit the resolution value
    (and any direct-dep version), then ``yarn install``
  - undeclared transitive -> add a ``resolutions`` entry, then ``yarn install``

then regenerating ``yarn.lock``.

Toolchain is baked into the image (Node 22 / yarn 1.22, matching what
OpenSearch-Dashboards CI reads from its ``.nvmrc`` + ``engines.yarn`` on main).
Reading the toolchain per-repo dynamically is deferred.
